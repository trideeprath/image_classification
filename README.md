# image_classification
Python and tensorflow based image classification

Code for training a image classifier based on inception_resnet_v2 
Can be used with pretrained imagenet models (transfer learning)


## Requirements
* Python 3 +
* Tensorflow 1.2 +


This code is mostly based on : https://github.com/kwotsin/transfer_learning_tutorial

## Changes
* Compatible with Python 3 and tensorflow 1.2 
* Added Script for classification which does not require preprocessing. Just create a folder of images and run test_classification.py
